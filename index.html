Wheat is among one of the most fundamental agricultural commodities in the United States, so understanding and ultimately predicting the price of this commodity will allow us to understand an essential part of our economic ecosystem. Our team has diverse backgrounds in engineering and science, so we wanted to choose a topic that has profound global implications. One of the grand challenges identified by the leaders of the U.N. and world bank is the shortage of food in our ever growing population. We thought it would be interesting for us to be able to build predictive forecasting of the stock price of this key commodity.</font></p>

                        <p align="left">Based on the previous regression analysis, some features were eliminated while others were refined. Inflation data proved to have little correlation with that month's wheat prices, so it was not considered in the formation of our support vector machine (SVM) predictive model. Since corn and sorghum prices had such a strong positive correlation to wheat prices, those were included in the model.For the climate data, our regression model suggests that these climate features may have a very small effect on wheat price. However, there are improvements to be made when we consider only a segment of the states. Since the regression analysis suggests slightly better correlations when only considering the top wheat producing states, the data is constricted to the top 10 wheat producing states in the predictive model.</p>
                    <br>
                

                    <h4 align="left"><font color="#282828">Initial SVM Model</h4>                        
                    <p align="left">  In our first attempt to predict price, we ran a linear SVM model with all of our features and we were only able to obtain accuracy values of less than 2%. (We did not include this data in our project as the model had sub-par predictive value) We concluded that our data probably lacked the specific resolution needed to predict a precise price. Hence we pivoted our predictive model to forecast the change, whether price would increase or decrease in a given month, in price in wheat instead (a metric we believe to also be very important to wheat economics). Seeing that sorghum and corn prices correlate so well with wheat, we fed in sorghum and corn price and change in price to the model (we created indicator variables for the change: 1 if % change was positive and 0 if negative).  We were able to achieve an accuracy on train and test data of .716 and .603. </p>

                    <h4 align="left"><font color="#282828">Optimized Feature Engineered SVM Model</h4>                 
                    <p align="left">  Seeing that these related crops had strong predictive power, we investigated features that tie these grain commodities together, specifically climactic factors such as temperature, precipitation, and drought data. Feeding all this data in our linear SVM, we were able to further improve our accuracy on train and test data to be ~85% and ~80% respectively. </p>

                    <p align="left">From our analysis including building linear regression models for each factor vs. the price wheat, we can see that the factors that most strongly correlate with wheat price are the corn and sorghum price.  Specifically, for these two factors we analyze further the regression statistics and see that corn and sorghum price have an R-squared correlation value of .792 and .832 respectively. Temperature and precipitation turned out to not have much correlation with the price of wheat. Specifically looking at drought, we also explored the relationship between the Palmer Drought Severity Index (standardized drought indicator) and the price of wheat. Though the regression faired slightly better than both temperature and precipitation, as we were able to see a slight positive correlation between drought and wheat price, it did not perform nearly as well as sorghum and wheat price.</p>

                    <p align="left">Seeing that sorghum and corn has such a high correlation with wheat price, we were interested to see whether this was simply due to the fact that sorghum, corn, and wheat were all grains and therefore were affected by many similar economic and climactic factors or was it a general trait among commodities over time. To investigate this aim, we picked another agricultural commodity, cotton, that had lesser similarities with wheat. We also investigate how inflation correlates with the wheat price. Performing a simple linear regression on wheat vs. cotton price, we see that there is very little correlation between the two. Inflation also has a very marginal correlation. From these findings, we reason that the correlation between agricultural prices are not simply due pure agricultural economics alone. Similar grains commodities that grow similarly exhibit much more significant correlation than unrelated crops.</p>

                    <h3 align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF ">Support Vector Machine Results</h4> 
                    <p align="left">Understanding that perhaps there might be some predictive power in temperature, precipitation, and drought, we decided to process the data with a more sophisticated model this time—specifically a support vector machine (SVM) that takes into account all these factors along with corn and sorghum price. Running a linear SVM model to predict price, we were only able to obtain accuracy values of less than 2%. This is probably because inherently our data is not at the resolution where we can predict the nuanced fluctuation in prices which change by the hour. Most of our data is quantified by the month. Knowing this invariable limitation, we pivot our predictive model to forecast whether price will increase or decrease rather than giving a specific price. </p>
                    <br>

                    <p align="left">We first feed into our SVM model simply two factors the indicator variable for whether the percentage of price increases or decreases for corn and sorghum. From this initial SVM model we get accuracy on training and test data of .716 and .603, respectively. In effort to improve this model we added in temperature and precipitation data from the top 10 wheat producing states, inflation rate and the percentage of price change. From this new model we were able to improve the accuracy on the training and test data to .7388 and .7931, respectively.  </p>

                    <h3 align="left"><font color="#7F7F7F">Interpretation and Discussion</h3>
                    <p align="left" font color="#7F7F7F">Overall, our data analysis and predictive models reveal a handful of interesting discoveries about wheat crop production and pricing in the United States. Most notably, we conclude that many climactic factors may not cause extreme change to the growth and harvest behavior of wheat. We did not see a strong dependency between wheat prices and temperature or precipitation, both at annual and monthly resolutions. Furthermore, even when we attemped to introduce time lags to account for crop growth, harvest, and transport time, we failed to find a strong correlation with environmental factors. This conslusion, supported by nearly all of our analysis methods, suggests that wheat growth in modern farm infrastructures is stable, perhaps as a result of advanced irrigation systems that allow for proper crop hydration even during the most severe periods of drought. Hence wheat price does not greatly fluctuate due to these factors. This may also suggest that wheat is overproduced in the United States, and that crop reserves may be utilized to offset the effects of non-ideal climactic conditions. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p align="left" font color="#7F7F7F">
                    On the other hand, corn and sorghum both exhibit a much higher degree of correlation with wheat price, prompting our team to believe that the general economics of agriculture is a more significant determining factor for wheat price. We selected these two crops for their similarities in growth conditions and applications to wheat. The high correlation between sorghum, wheat, and corn prices may be explained by the fact that they are recognized as substitute goods - low supply and high demand for one crop will cause a subsequent rise in price for the other two crops as well. This would explain why we see such a high degree of correlation between these three crops. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p align="left" font color="#7F7F7F">To look into this correlation further, we also analyzed the price of cotton, a crop very different from wheat in terms of growth conditions and applications. In this case, we found very little correlation between price of wheat and cotton. This result suggests that there is some factor - perhaps climactic or economic - that affects the production and price of wheat and cotton very differently. Perhaps this suggests that climactic factors still do play a role in pricing. In an effort to reassess whether our previous climactic features have any predictive power, we establish a more sophisticated model using a linear SVM and found that in fact feeding in more data (including climactic data) helps improve accuracy of prediction.  </p>

                    <h3 align="left"><font color="#7F7F7F">Future Work</h3>
                    <p align="left" font color="#7F7F7F">In the future, we would like to continue feeding in more data of interrelated crops and more nuanced data about soil, air quality, and even fertilizers. Although the correlation may be relatively low, we have shown that feeding more datasets into more sophisticated models results in improvements in classiication accuracy. We can also search for data at a higher resolutions (perhaps by week or day) to further research the time lag involved in crop growth, harvest, and pricing. The ability to better predict this offset would be very insightful towards harvesting in itself. We could also explore using alternative statistical models to increase our accuracy scores.</p>

                                <p>When looking at precipitation, the first step was to compare the averaged cumulative rainfall of all the states with wheat price. The results are suggest little to no correlation. However, this data considers many states that don't even produce wheat, and the winter months when wheat isn't being grown. To account for these factors, the data was then cut to only examine the data of the top 5 wheat-producing states in the US.</p>

                                <p>Here, the correlations between precipitation and wheat price still aren't very correlated. The data points tend to be clumped in the the bottom left corner of the graph (left). There are some fairly large outliers in this dataset, but a clear correlation can't be found, regardless. Averaging the data for the 5 states (right) doesn't have much impact either. As a last step toward refining the data to compare, the data was constricted to the months of March through October, which marks the beginning and end of the wheat growing season.</p>

                                <p>This further refined comparison provides no new results, suggesting that precipitation does not have a large effect on wheat prices, much like temperature. However, looking at the very tops of all four of these graphs, there appears to be a slightly negative correlation, albeit a weak one. This very small correlation led to preciptation's inclusion in our later model.</p>

                                <p>The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is a way to quantifiably describe drought conditions of a specific region. The index ranges from -4.0 to 4.0. In this index, -4.0 represents a very severe drought, 0 represents mild conditions, and a 4.0 represents abnormally wet conditions. The map above shows the PDSI by state in the year 2005, which was recorded to be a hard drought year for certain states such as Arkansas and Wyoming.</p>

                                <p>The above graphs show the PDSI of the top 5 states versus the wheat price, individually (left) and averaged together (right). There is not a strong correlation between these two factors, and nowhere near the correlation between wheat and corn/sorghum. However, in general, as the PDSI increases, the likelihood of having extremely high wheat prices decreases as well. This indicates that there is possibly a small negative correlation. Although it isn't close to being linear, this small trend warranted more investigation by using it in the predictive model.</p>
