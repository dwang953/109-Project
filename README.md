<h1> What's The Price of Wheat? </h1>
CS 109 Final Project

By Vinh Nguyen, Andy Tran, Daniel Wang, Fanney Zhu

<h3> Background & Motivation: </h3>
We chose to create a predictor of the stock price of wheat because of the ever-pervasive fluctuation in food prices. Wheat is among one of the most fundamental agricultural commodities in the United States, so understanding and ultimately predicting the price of this commodity will allow us to understand an essential part of our economic ecosystem. Our team has diverse backgrounds in engineering and science, so we wanted to choose a topic that has profound global implications. One of the grand challenges identified by the leaders of the U.N. and world bank is the shortage of food in our ever growing population. We thought it would be interesting for us to be able to build predictive forecasting of the stock price of this key commodity.

<h3> Project: </h3>
This project was created using standard Python libraries, using a project notebook in iPython/Jupyter. The main project notebook, detailing the entire process of data scraping, exploratory data analysis, and our various models, can be found in 'What's_the_Price_of_Wheat.ipynb'. The data we used for our project can be found in the 'data' folder of this GitHub Repository. All of our data which was cleaned during the project process is stored in the 'cleaned_data' folder of this repository. The 'working_notebooks' folder goes through some individual draft bits of the project that we worked on individually. Finally, the 'website' folder provides the code used to create the website for this predictor, and 'index.html' is the html code for our website.
